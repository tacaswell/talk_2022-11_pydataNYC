 - Trained as a physicist
   - studied jammed amorphous systems + dynamics of Leidenfrost drops
 - <2-> Currently developing data acquisition at NSLS-II

 - <2-> PSF Fellow (Q2 2022)

** Acknowledgments

- Michael Droettboom, Eric Firing, and the Matplotlib team
- <2-> Dan Allan, Ken Lauer
- <3-> Dora Caswell

* Open source and open science
** Software is core to the future of science
- Almost all modern experimental science is relies on software
- <2-> Software lets you ask different questions
- <3-> software encapsulates techniques in a re-usable and transferable way

** What is "Big Data" anyway?
- "Bigger than you are used to"
- <2-> Perrin did initial work on Brownian motion of particles in 1908
  - <2-> Traced colloid tracks by hand using /camera lucida/,
  - <2-> order hundreds to thousands of displacements measured.
  - <2-> Physics Nobel Prize in 1926
- <3-> I also tracked Brownian motion
  - <3-> 20,000 particles per frame over thousands of frames
  - <4-> could only (practically) be done with software to find and track the colloids

** tracking fringes
- brief introduction to Leidenfrost drops + interference images
- Justin Burton (post-doc at time now faculty at Emory) had done initial work
  by manually counting fringes
- said "I bet you can automate that and get a time series of the profile"
  - 2011-11 started work, got prototype working
  - 2012-06 pulled linking code out to =trackpy=
  - 2013-12 defended on this work, submitted PRE
- 1TB of high-speed video to extract dynamics of the rim
  - 300k frames with 100s of fringes per frame
- science that could not have been done without software


** "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants"
-- Isaac Newton

- All of this was made possible by the Scientific Python ecosystem
- <2-> open sourcing my linking code has had way more impact on science than my research
  - <2-> paper cited 40 times
  - <2-> trackpy has been cited 291 times


** Software is a team sport

Subject: tracking.py

Hi Thomas,

I'm a physics grad at JHU working for Bob Leheny, who is himself a former
student of Sidney Nagel. I came across your website a few years ago by way of
Eric Weeks' page. Today I checked in on your site and found your pure Python
implementation of track.pro.


Over the last few months I implemented the Crocker/Weeks particle location
algorithm in pure Python (with a little C). I know you have done the same in
C++. Currently, I'm still calling IDL to do the trajectory-linking step, but I
am about to try switching to your tracking.py. I'm letting you know that I'm
using it, as you request on your web page. Also, maybe we should consider
contributing to each other's repositories.

Here's mine: https://github.com/danielballan/mr

Cheers,
Dan

** Software is a team sport

- This led to merging our code bases
- About 30 people have now contributed to code base
- many of the citations out of initial field
- The code enabled (and was driven by) our own research, but has had a far
  greater impact on science than just what we published

** What did I learn in grad school?
- advanced our understanding of jamming transition and the dynamics of the
  vapor layer under a Leidenfrost drop
- Software is critical to the future of science
- I enjoyed software development more than doing the science
- scientists do not have time to be both professional software engineers AND do
  science
- changed career goal from being a Professor to what ever job let me develop
  software tools for scientists
  - "Research Software Engineer" is starting to be a thing, my current job
    title at BNL is "Computational Scientist"
  - us-rse org + job board

* Matplotlib

** How did I start to work on Matplotlib?
- opened a PR to solve a problem I had (10yrs ago in August)
- Started answering questions on StackOverflow about Matplotlib while
  procrastinating my research (sorry Sid)
- Eventually started reporting + fixing bugs upstream
- was offered commit rights and asked to start reviewing other PRs
- was offered co-lead in 2014 (check date)
- was offered lead in 2016 (check date)

* Bluesky

** at BNL
- started as a post-doc at BNL working on analysis tools for a data platform
- ... eventually started to work on the data platform
- ... and then on the data acquisition system
- 1 year in Dan Allan joined me as a fellow post-doc
- unique opportunity at NSLS-II because
  - it was a new facility so no incumbent solution
  - the scientific Python stack was really starting to pick up steam
  - availability of document-store database
  - very supportive management committed to open source and open science

** Dawn of Bluesky
- goal is to connect experimental data into the scientific Python world with
  enough meta-data to be useful
- started as a "for NSLS-II" project
  - but we started working in the open
- other US facilities found it useful (SLAC)
- now used by:
  - the 5 DOE light sources
  - international synchrotrons
  - university labs
  - individual grad students / researchers

* Lessons learned


** Why did this work?

- co-designed but independent libraries
- Developed in the open from the start
  - anyone can see the code
  - anyone can see and participate in the discussions
  - anyone can influence the code
- invite users to become collaborators

** What does the RSE role not look like?

- CS departments "doing software for the domain scientists" does not work
  - incentives are too different
- Just hiring a "software person" for 1-800-fix-mycode does not work
  - demoralizing for RSE
  - leaves a lot of expertise and creativity on the table

** What does the RSE role looks like?

- must be partnership between RSE and scientists
  - RSE needs to understand enough of domain to make good decisions
  - scientist needs to know enough software to have a conversation
- Communication is key
  - what assumptions are safe to make?
  - where are the likely extension points?
  - Is something worth the technical cost to build it?
  - What are the right trade offs / abstractions?
- Both sides are bringing important expertise to the table

** Science and software are team activities

- Myth of "lone genius" is harmful in both science and software
- useful software is frequently bigger than one person can physically write
  - particularly if you include the whole stack!
- every piece of software I've written with someone is better than everyone I
  wrote alone
- science (as a whole) is a collaborative effort to understand how the world
  works.
  - the nominal reason we publish is to share knowledge with others and the reason we

** Advice
- Software is essential to doing science.
- Do not need to be a professional software developer, but software development
  is a required professional skill
  - just like writing prose is a required professional skill [credit Numba
  developer]
  - just like calculus is a required professional skill
- Have a library mentality from the start
- Work in the open from the start
- Make friends, build collaborations!
