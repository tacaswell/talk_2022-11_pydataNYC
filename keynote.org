* Open source and open science
** Software is core to the future of science
- Software is critical to (almost) all modern experimental science [1].
- <2-> ... lets you ask different questions.
- <3-> ... encapsulates techniques in a re-usable and transferable way.

Subject: tracking.py \\

Hi Thomas, \\

I'm a physics grad at JHU working for Bob Leheny, who is himself a former
student of Sidney Nagel. I came across your website a few years ago by way of
Eric Weeks' page. Today I checked in on your site and found your pure Python
implementation of track.pro. \\



Over the last few months I implemented the Crocker/Weeks particle location
algorithm in pure Python (with a little C). I know you have done the same in
C++. Currently, I'm still calling IDL to do the trajectory-linking step, but I
am about to try switching to your tracking.py. I'm letting you know that I'm
using it, as you request on your web page. Also, maybe we should consider
contributing to each other's repositories. \\

Here's mine: https://github.com/danielballan/mr \\

Cheers,
Dan


** Software is a team sport

- <+-> This led to merging our code bases
  - About 30 people have now contributed to code base
- <+-> Dan joined me at BNL and is my closest collaborator

** Science and software are team activities

- <+-> Myth of "lone genius" is harmful in both science and software
- <+-> Science (as a whole) is a collaborative effort to understand how the world
  works.
  - the nominal reason we publish is to share knowledge
- <+-> Useful software is bigger than one person can physically write
  - particularly if you include the whole stack!
- <+-> Every piece of software I've written together is better than any I wrote
  alone

** Library mindset

- <+-> What assumptions does this make?
- <+-> If I do this what _won't_ I be able to do in the future?
- <+-> Does it leave me a path to the next thing I might want?
- <+-> What information does each part of the program need to know?
- <+-> If I make this change who do I break?

* Software, science, and RSEs

** What do you need to "maintain" an open source project?

#+begin_center
*You are a maintainer if you feel responsible for the project.*
#+end_center

- <2-> A stewardship (not ownership) mindset
  - the project has value because it solves (other) people's problems
  - project may have existed before you and you want it to exist after you
- <3-> Empathy
  - frequently getting users who are having a (very) bad day
  - everyone is coming from a different place
- <4-> Community management and people skills
  - See Melissa Weber Mendonça's keynote tomorrow!
  - Software is a team sport
- <5-> Technical skills
  - "the easy part"


** ..and you still do science?!

- <2-> no
  - <3-> ...but have *enabled* a lot of science and helped a lot of scientists
- <3-> Scientists do not have time to be domain experts **AND** professional developers
- <4-> However basic programming is a required professional skill
  - like math, paper writing, and grant writing

** How did I start to work on Matplotlib?
- opened a PR to solve a problem I had (10yrs ago in August)
  - https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/1062
- started answering questions on StackOverflow about Matplotlib while
  procrastinating my research (sorry Sid)
- eventually started reporting & fixing bugs upstream
- was offered commit rights and asked to start reviewing other PRs
- was offered co-lead in 2014
- was offered lead in 2016
